gnment about a project of proramming  i want to know somethings about it
You said:
this assignment to must include some steps The Six-Step Problem-Solving Methodology
Your screencast and repository must provide clear evidence of you following these six steps. You are encouraged to use your AI partner at every step.

Understand the Problem:

Action: Read the problem description and identify the core goals and requirements.

Evidence: In your screencast, narrate your understanding. Show your conversation with your AI (e.g., "Help me break down the requirements for this problem," "What is the main goal of this program?").

Identify the Inputs and Outputs:

Action: Clearly list the data the program needs from the user (inputs) and what it must produce (outputs), including data saved to files.

Evidence: Narrate this process. Show AI conversation (e.g., "What are the specific inputs for the 'Add Transaction' feature?", "What outputs should the 'View Balance' function produce?").

Work the Problem by Hand:

Action: Manually walk through a simple example. For instance, start with an empty budget, add two income transactions and one expense, and manually calculate the final balance.

Evidence: Show this process, perhaps in your planning.md file or just by narrating it. You can use your AI to create a sample scenario (e.g., "Give me 3 sample transactions to test my logic by hand.").

Create Pseudocode:

Action: Develop an algorithm for your program. Write pseudocode in your planning.md file. Plan the functions you will need.

Evidence: Create and show the planning.md file. Show your AI conversation (e.g., "Review my pseudocode for adding a transaction," "Help me plan the functions I'll need.").

Convert to Python:

Action: Write the Python code in your Google Colab notebook (main.ipynb), translating your pseudocode. This step includes debugging any errors that appear.

Evidence: Show your coding process. When you get stuck or encounter an error, do not edit the screencast. Show the error, and then show your AI conversation (e.g., "How do I use pyinputplus to accept only 'income' or 'expense'?", "I'm getting this FileNotFoundError, how can I use try/except to handle it?").

Test with a Variety of Data:

Action: Test your code to ensure it works correctly with different inputs (e.g., test with no transactions, with one transaction, with multiple income/expense transactions).

Evidence: Your code must include at least two assert() statements to test a core function (e.g., your balance calculation). Show yourself running these tests and manually testing the program's menu with different data.
You said:
no i m,ean the project i m going to start must follow the above 6 steps 
You said:
just listEN ME first dont just rush going on i havent given you the project yet i just have given you the 6 step rules which we are going to follow while doing the project
You said:
thankyou let me copy do the project

 The Programming Problem: Simple Personal Budget Manager
You are to create a command-line application in a Google Colab notebook that allows a user to track their personal income and expenses.

Core Requirements:
Main Menu: The program must run in a loop, presenting the user with a menu of options:

Add Transaction

View All Transactions

View Current Balance

Save & Exit

Data Storage: All transactions must be stored in a Pandas DataFrame. When the program starts, it must check if a file named budget.csv exists.

If it does exist, load it into a DataFrame.

If it does not exist, create an empty DataFrame with columns: ['date', 'description', 'type', 'amount'].

Use a try/except block to handle the FileNotFoundError.

Add Transaction:

Prompt the user for the transaction details.

Use pyinputplus for all inputs.

date: Use pyip.inputDate() (or pyip.inputStr() if you prefer YYYY-MM-DD format).

description: Use pyip.inputStr().

type: Use pyip.inputChoice(['income', 'expense']).

amount: Use pyip.inputFloat(min=0.01).

Add this new transaction as a new row to your DataFrame.

View All Transactions:

Display the entire Pandas DataFrame.

If no transactions exist, print a message "No transactions yet."

View Current Balance:

Calculate the total balance by subtracting total 'expense' from total 'income'.

Print the balance in a clear format (e.g., "Current Balance: $XXX.XX").

Testing: You must write at least one function for this logic and test it with an assert() statement.

Save & Exit:

Save the current Pandas DataFrame to budget.csv (overwriting the old one).

Print a "Goodbye!" message and exit the program loop.

Technical Constraints:
Your solution must be written in your main.ipynb Colab notebook.

You must use functions to organize your code (e.g., show_menu(), add_transaction(), calculate_balance(), etc.).

You must use pandas for data handling and CSV I/O.

You must use pyinputplus for user input validation.

Warning: Use of advanced features you cannot explain (e.g., full OOP classes, unittest framework) may result in a follow-up viva (oral exam) to verify your understanding.
You said:
OK NOW THE REAL deal i really dont much about how to do this
You said:
well i just upload main.ipynb in collab what to do next
You said:
how to install pyinputplus
You said:
what is next step afer this
You said:
it show NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

now it show name column is not defined ameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

You said:
first of all let me tell you whta i have done i have upload the budget zip and all its internal files on google collab then ithen i manual install !pip install pyinputplus  then i copy the _test_df = pd.DataFrame([
    {'date':'2025-01-01','description':'gift','type':'income','amount':100.0},
    {'date':'2025-01-02','description':'shift pay','type':'income','amount':350.0},

assert calculate_balance(pd.DataFrame(columns=COLUMNS)) == 0.0
print('All asserts passed ✅')  and then run it 
You said:
how to run next code cell
You said:
now it show calculate balance is not defined
You said:
it shows all assereted passed and what to do next
You said:
well this is my last cell test_df = pd.DataFrame([
    {'date':'2025-01-01','description':'gift','type':'income','amount':100.0},
    {'date':'2025-01-02','description':'shift pay','type':'income','amount':350.0},

assert calculate_balance(pd.DataFrame(columns=COLUMNS)) == 0.0
print('All asserts passed ✅')
You said:
well let me paste all cell code 1 by 1 1st is import pandas as pd

def calculate_balance(df: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    if df.empty:
        return 0.0
    inc = df.loc[df['type'] == 'income', 'amount'].sum()
    exp = df.loc[df['type'] == 'expense', 'amount'].sum()
    return float(inc - exp) and second is !pip install pyinputplus and third is CSV_PATH = Path('budget.csv')
COLUMNS = ['date','description','type','amount']
 and last is  test_df = pd.DataFrame([
    {'date':'2025-01-01','description':'gift','type':'income','amount':100.0},
    {'date':'2025-01-02','description':'shift pay','type':'income','amount':350.0},

assert calculate_balance(pd.DataFrame(columns=COLUMNS)) == 0.0
print('All asserts passed ✅')
You said:
the code of app show error name csv path not defined
You said:
it doesnt show any # it just show all assereted passed
You said:
its how error when i run main it shwo name'pyip' is not defined
You said:
it working now
